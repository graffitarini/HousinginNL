# HousinginNL
My first documentation on looking for current housing prices in three main cities in the Netherlands. 
I scraped the data of NL Housing Market website Pararius(dot)com using Python and converted it into CSV file. 
Then, using pandas_profiling env, I run three lines of python code to import ProfileReport show dataset statistics 
which useful to investigate on data's correlation, missing values and possibilities for further EDA process.
